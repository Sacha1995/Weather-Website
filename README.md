# Can the kids play outside?

This was the first project that we implemented an API call into our work. The project is written in vanilla JavaScript where the JavaScript renders the html dynamically dependant on the response from the API. I have also included some nice responsive design into the project and added some humour to accommodate for a great user experience.
